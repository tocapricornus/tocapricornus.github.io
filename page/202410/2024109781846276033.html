[발췌]
 
It had been the beginning of summer two years ago when his sister-in-law had cut her wrist open in his house. Theyd moved there only recently, wanting the extra floor space, and his wifes family had all come round for lunch. Hed heard about his sister-in-law apparently turning vegetarian, something which hadnt sat at all well with this family of meat-lovers, the father in particular. Shed been so pitifully thin, it wasnt as though he couldnt understand them giving her a strict dressing down. But that her father, the Vietnam War hero, had actually struck his rebellious daughter in the facr and physically found a lump of meat into her mouth, that was something else. However much he thought back on it, he couldnt convince himself that it had actually happened - It was more like a scene from some bizarre play. More vivid and frightening than any other was the momory of the scream that had erupted from his sister-in-law when the lump of meat approached her lips. After spitting it out, shed snatched up the fruit knife and glared fiercely at each of her family in turn, her terrified eyes rolling like those of a cornered animal. Once the blood was gushing out of her wrist hed torn a strip from one of their qui&lt;s, bound it around her wrist and picked her up, her body so light she could almost have been a ghost.
